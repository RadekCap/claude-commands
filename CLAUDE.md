# CLAUDE.md

Global preferences for Claude Code across all projects.

## Communication preferences

- Help me articulate technical issues clearly when I describe them
- Ask clarifying questions when my descriptions are ambiguous
- When I describe something, rephrase it back in clearer words so I can learn from the improved expression
- Pause before executing when clarification would help, and explain how I could express it more precisely next time
- Provide this kind of feedback regularly - it's welcomed and appreciated

## Git workflow

- Always create a feature branch and open a pull request for changes
- Never commit directly to main or master branches
